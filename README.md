Eurorack AD/ASR envelope and CV generator

This module generates a bipolar control voltage in response to a gate/trigger pulse.
The button selects how it responds to an input pulse: Attack-Decay or Attack-Sustain-Release. 
The zero and triggered (peak) levels are separately set anywhere within the output voltage range (-5 - +5 V).
